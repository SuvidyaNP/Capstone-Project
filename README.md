# Predicting hospital readmission of Diabetic Patients

## Introduction
The dataset used in this project is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains patient information related to diabetes and hospital readmissions. This dataset contains 101,766 rows and 50 columns. It includes various medical features such as patient demographics, health conditions, and past medical history, as well as the target variable indicating whether a patient was readmitted or not.

In this project, extensive data cleaning and preprocessing steps were taken to handle missing values, standardize categorical variables, and scale numerical features.


## Objectives
To build an efficient model that predicts the likelihood of diabetic patients being readmitted to the hospital within 30 days.

## Steps done:
  Data Collection
  Data Preprocessing - Data Cleaning
  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  Feature Engineering
  Feature Selection
  Split Data into Training and Testing Sets
  Feature Scaling
